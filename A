I am not frustrated with remote work. I have worked this way before as well and my previous colleagues were very cooperative then.

Can work independently but Cannot work in Isolation as I don't receive any prompt responses on emails and meeting schedules. Either I don't response or meetings are cancelled at the very last minute

I think there was no intent to pass on the knowledge and cannot consult the architect for some valid reasons.

Sometimes fix may be very easy but Investigating and identifying the root cause takes a lot of time. 
was Working more than 4 hours a day and also worked on a few weekends and I haven't charged anything on those.

I did not imagine how demotivating it would be as I thought I would be part of some amazing project in HTML5/angularJS and as you are aware that flex is already dead now and I see no future in this. I would rather spend some time after my regular work hours and learn something new things on my own.

Its better for the firm and for me to quit rather than sitting and trying to find something which takes a lot of time on this.

I would like to quit.
